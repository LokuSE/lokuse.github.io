# Squarespace Customer Reviews & FAQ

> ![thumb-down](/assets/thumb-down.png) Hello!! ---- Very disappointed! with my newly acquired knowledge I delved into Square Space to begin the process of building my web site but nipped out again to read some personal reviews on those who had already done so ------ Oh! My!! Won't work with Safari!! (what I use) you didn't mention that!!! but perhaps it wasn't relevant to the comparison study. So many people saying that the customer support is lousy others saying that they take the money but do not give any help I do appreciate that you were making an unbiased comparison of SquareSpace and Wix --- and not necessarily a review of actual use! The number of people using Square Space giving VERY negative feedback of their experiences has really given me cold feet.
> > Sorry to hear you're having issues. Squarespace does support Safari but only on a Mac I'm afraid. Our recent study found that Squarespace had an overall satisfaction rating of 90%, so it's surprising to hear your feedback but we can appreciate how off putting it can be to read bad reviews of a builder. If you're looking for a something that offers sleek and stylish templates, intuitive mobile responsiveness, and full customization, then we'd definitely recommend Squarespace. If you're still unsure however, why not check out some of our other reviews, such as Wix and Weebly, before making your final call. I hope that helps you find your perfect builder!

> ![thumb-down](/assets/thumb-down.png) I really regret creating my online store with SquareSpace. I'm based in California and the sales tax rules are so complex and there's no way to have them automatically calculated in SquareSpace. I have to enter them manually, which is time consuming and easily done incorrectly. The offer Stripe as a payment option, but the version they offer doesn't allow for integration with companies like TaxJar who can automatically calculate the sales tax for each purchase. I would strongly discourage anyone in California from creating an online store using SquareSpace...go with Shopify or the like. It'll save you loads of time and potential tax issues/fines.
> >  hanks for the really interesting insight! In our experience Shopify is certainly a market leader when it comes to payment options. SquareSpace does have a discussion that might help if you're still looking for [answers](https://answers.squarespace.com/questions/68621/how-to-handle-local-sales-tax-rates.html)

>![question](/assets/question.png) Hi I currently have an Etsy store and want to have my own website. I've been reading all the reviews and onfo which is really informative, thanksðŸ˜Šbut still don't know which is best for me. I want to sell & for it to look good. Any advise would be appreciated
> > `A:` You've certainly come to the right place. I would suggest scanning my comparison chart for ecommerce builders. A general rule of thumb we like to recommend is that if you want to sell more than 10 products, Shopify is the best bet for starting an online store. Good luck!

<br>

>![thumb-up](/assets/thumb-up.png) I cannot stress enough on how easy, simplified and straight to the point using squarespace is! I was able to get my website up and running (from buying the Domain name, to choosing a theme and filling the content) in 2 hours only!

<br>

>![thumb-up](/assets/thumb-up.png) I love Squarespace for the reason you listed below - it has such stylish and elegant templates. That said, I want clients to be able to book and pay for appointments online. What do you think of Squarespace for that purpose?
> > `A:` It sounds like you need Squarespace's integration with Acuity Scheduling. There's more information [here](https://support.squarespace.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002308008-Adding-online-booking-to-your-site) In our experience, Wix is the market leader when it comes to fully-integrated booking features. Just take a look at WixHotels! Hope this helps

> ![thumb-down](/assets/thumb-down.png) I have had my site with Squarespace since 2009 and I've loved it--until now. My site is down and their email-only customer service tells me it will be DAYS until I can expect a response. DAYS. My business website, upon which I depend for my livelihood, will be down for DAYS. If your site is just for fun, then by all means. But think twice if you're serious. Their front-line customer service people have quick, friendly answers to easy questions that appear in their knowledgbase. But when it comes to something really going wrong, their "experts" are shockingly overwhelmed. They claim that they take downtime seriously, but in reality they don't have the staff to do so.
> > `A:` Thank you for sharing your current experience with the rest of the community. Your difficulty with SquareSpaceâ€™s customer service dose strike me as a little odd and something I have not heard of before. Have you been able to identify the cause to your site being down? When you spoke to SquareSpace were they able to communicate the reason back to you? Iâ€™d personally chase them for a more immediate response, potentially trying their live chat function. You can find the live chat support page [here](https://support.squarespace.com/hc/en-us/articles/219648707-How-do-I-contact-Customer-Care-) (just note that the live chat only works between the hours of 4AM and 8PM Eastern Time, Monday through Friday): Hopefully, you will be able to reach someone much quicker and then get to the bottom of the issues. I hope you get this resolved soon.

>![question](/assets/question.png) Hi and thank you for the great review. I have to say - after seeing the Keanu ad during the superbowl - it made me research the site. I am completely NEW to starting a website and blogging. My goal is to start up a blog by the end of Feb. So far I've researched Wordpress and Squarespace - but it's all so confusing!! Do you have any articles about blog sites in general - maybe a comparison of all of them?? Any recommendations from anyone would be helpful!
> > `A:`  Great to hear that Keanu has piqued your interest in building a website ;) It's definitely a great time to get involved as you have loads of options at your fingertips. You can opt for user-friendly, drag-and-drop website builders like Wix, Weebly and Squarespace if you're not too technical and don't know how to code. Or you can opt for a more sophisticated platform like WordPress, which is a lot more customizable BUT requires you to have at least a basic knowledge and understanding of coding to really max out its potential. A good place to start comparing website builders is my comparison chart. Hope it helps + good luck with your building!

>![question](/assets/question.png) Hi, We have a medium sized fashion label (we currently stock in 50 stores internationally. Our brand doesn't sell online and won't as it's specialist and women who buy our product want To try it on. We used to be on shopify but changed to square space about 4 years ago as we were not selling online and we wanted to make image / collections changes online ourselves . We have had a quieter year and took consultancy advice. One of the opinions was that our site looked 'amature' because it is on SS and that we shouldn't change back for better SEO. Is this true or just industry design snobbery ? Would a consumer really know ? And surely SEO is the quality of your content and back links? Your opinion would be greatly valued !
> > `A:` I'm actually really surprised to hear that people have said that about your website because it's built on Squarespace! For what it's worth, I find that Squarespace has some of the most incredible and stylish template designs of ANY website builder. Both my housemates agree - one's a photographer and the other is a graphic designer, and both have Squarespace portfolios... The only thing I can suggest (if you haven't already), is to go into the Squarespace editor and remove the 'powered by Squarespace' text block form the bottom of your chosen template. It should just be click -> edit -> delete. This is the only way a consumer would know your site is built on Squarespace, unless they really looked into the page source code - but who really does that?! As for SEO, Squarespace is generally pretty well regarded. They even provide [helpful SEO tips](https://support.squarespace.com/hc/en-us/articles/205814568-Increasing-your-site-s-visibility-to-search-engines) to guide your optimization efforts. But otherwise you've hit the nail on the head - SEO is about creating high quality content for your desired audience and building a great backlink profile. The fact you're aware of this tells me you're in pretty good shape already. If you don't plan on selling, you should be absolutely fine on Squarespace. Maybe test out a redesign with a different template every few years, but otherwise you should be golden! Hope that helps :)

>![thumb-up](/assets/thumb-up.png) Great article! I'm looking into building a website simply and as easily and am new to website building as a whole. The points you've touched on here have been really informative. I don't mind a little bit of a learning curve, I think that would probably allow for more personal customization and add to the uniqueness of the site as opposed to a 'pure' drag-and-drop system while also making it accessible for someone like me who doesn't want to spend time or have the money to do it the 'hard' way. Thanks for sharing this review!
> > `A:` Great to hear you found the review so useful! I think you're right to point out that having a learning curve would probably lead to more impressive (and rewarding) results down the line. If you haven't settled on a builder just yet, I'd recommend checking out my website builder comparison chart too as it may give you so more food for thought. Thanks for reading

> ![thumb-down](/assets/thumb-down.png) No mobile editor is a deal breaker for me. Such a shame - I was totally in but for a music artist, mobile use is pretty much all the traffic to the site and how it looks/functions is more important than desktop
> > `A:` I understand your frustrations. More and more people are using their mobile phones and tablets to browse the internet, so having a website that looks good on the go is really important. Yes it's frustrating that Squarespace doesn't have a dedicated mobile editor, like Wix for example, but it does ensure all of its templates are mobile responsive. This should ensure that your Squarespace website optimizes itself for any and all screen sizes. You may need to play around in the editor for a little bit to tweak everything just right, but the LEGO-style 'content block' system that Squarespace uses makes it quite easy to move content around if necessary. It'd be worth giving Squarespace's free trial a go and seeing how you get on. Hope that helps

<br>

>![thumb-up](/assets/thumb-up.png) This information was enormously useful in helping me to decide how to proceed with a website redesign for a non-profit. Thank you!

<br>

>![question](/assets/question.png) Thank you for the review. It helped me get to know better about SquareSpace besides all the places they advertise at through sponsorship. My Q is, Do you think It's a good option for doctors? I'm a MD who specializes in pediatrics and have a very personalized private practice. I ask this because you didn't mention us (doctors) on your "Is Squarespace ideal for you" section. I'm really interested in your opinion as experts. Thanks!
> > `A:`  I'm not sure how helpful this is to say, but it really does depend on your needs! Think about what you want your users to be able to do on your website. Is it there just for information purposes or do you want to accept bookings, or maybe some other functionality? In your situation, I would recommend signing up for a free trial with Squarespace and then having a browse to familiarize yourself with what can be achieved. You should also have a look through the app marketplace to see if there are plugins that can help you achieve the functionality you want to. It might be worth considering your options too though as Squarespace is normally used for clean, image-rich websites such as portfolios - not always. but this is where Squarespace tends to lend itself to better. Wix would be another good option to consider, as it offers a lot of similar functions to Squarespace and the editor is more intuitive to use. Hope that helps

<br>

>![question](/assets/question.png) I have site hosted elsewhere. I assume Squarespace has to host. How does that work with present site? Our site is non ecommerce, visitors encouraged to call or email? Is the transaction fee 2% for ecommerce sites I presume?
> > `A:` There are two types hosting: web hosting and domain hosting. Web hosting is where your website content is stored, which in this case will be Squarespace if you use their web builder. On the other hand we've got domain hosting, which provides your website domain name and is more like a street address that directs people. If using a Squarespace premium plan then you can use your existing domain name or purchase one to use with your site. You're also correct in your assumption that transaction fees are for ecommerce sites only. There should be no reason why users cannot contact you as long as you provide them with the information they need. Hope that helps

<br>

>![question](/assets/question.png) Very helpful review, but I have two questions. 1. I want to create a site that will be a forum, primarily, but will grow into a large one. Appearance is less important than ease of use. Would you recommend squarespace or another program? 2. How "user friendly" is the squarespace customer support service; can you call and get someone? Thank you
> > `A:` Good to hear you found the review helpful. Unfortunately Squarespace removed the in-built forum feature that was a part of Sqaurespace 5 and so far haven't shown any indication that they plan on bringing it back - they might, but they tend not to discuss new features before releasing them. A potential fix would be to research 3rd party plugins, it's not ideal but could solve your issue. As an alternative you could look into either Wix or Weebly, who both offer the ability to create forums without the need for additional 3rd party plugins. On the customer support front, it really depends how you define 'user friendly'. Squarespace provide a very in-depth support section on their website that covers a wide-range of issues across different skill levels and also allow users to submit tickets if their issue isn't covered elsewhere. There are also Squarespace 'Answer Forums' in which users can ask questions that are answered by the Squarespace community. This is usually enough for most users as the level of depth included in these answers is pretty good. However, if you're looking for phone support then I'm afraid Squarespace doesn't offer this (they even have a dedicated answer in their support section explaining why!). On the other hand, Weebly offers online chat, email and phone support, while Wix offers email and phone support which helps to add a level of real-time support not offered by Squarespace. Give our Wix and Weebly reviews a read and see what you think. If the forum is your end goal, I would definitely point you towards Wix over Squarespace.
