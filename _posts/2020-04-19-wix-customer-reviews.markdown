# Wix Customer Reviews 2020

>![thumb-up](/assets/thumb-up.png)
> For developers using Wix as a platform to build sites for their clients, it poses more of a problem, but for those looking for an easy, DIY website builder that they can adapt and tailor to their liking, Wix is ideal. Thanks again for raising some excellent points though, and we're grateful for your contribution to the conversation.

<br>

>![question](/assets/question.png) Is it suitable for building a food ordering website?
> > `A:` Hi there, Thanks for your comment. Wix is suitable for almost every industry, including food retail. You can choose industry-specific themes and integrate a number of food delivery apps to help, too. 

<br>

>![question](/assets/question.png) Would wix be an option for a hobby photographer wanting to have private site for sharing photos with friends and family. Ie not discoverable and photos viewable by invitation only? Do their security settings allow for this?
> > `A:` Wix allows you to create members-only areas and password protected pages so although you can't make your entire site 'not discoverable', you can publish your photos on pages that only your friends and family can view. Hope that helps and best of luck!

<br>

>![question](/assets/question.png) I keep hearing this statement - 'you can't change templates without loosing everything or you have to rebuild your page.' My question is: If you choose a blank template, you should be able to make as many changes inside it, just as long as you don't go and pick some other formal template? Is this correct? The attachment to that is of course, is there a blank template to choose from?
> >  `A:` Providing you stick with the same template, blank or not, you can make as many changes as you like. It's only when switching from one template to another where your content won't transfer over. Wix offers an array of [blank templates to choose from which you can see here](https://wix.com/website/templates/html/most-popular). Hope that helps!

<br>

>![question](/assets/question.png) We are a non-profit looking to build a crowdfunding platform. What are the pros and cons for using WIX?
> >`A:` Wix offers purpose built, non-profit templates for you to choose from, it supports multiple payment gateways such as PayPal, Stripe and Square, and thanks to its drag-and-drop editing interface, everything is totally customizable so you can tailor your site exactly to your liking. The downside is that you can't automatically switch templates, so it's important you spend time browsing their selection to ensure you make the right choice first time around. Hope that helps!

<br>

>![question](/assets/question.png) I could really use some answers to a few questions: Does Wix allow to export the email addresses for use with MailChimp or other platforms? Is it possible to create 2 websites? I would need an online shop and a simple presentation website within different categories.
> >`A:` Lets start with Mailchip. With Wix you can easily integrate Mailchimp by connecting your Wix contacts to your Mailchimp campaigns. This way, any contact added from your Wix site, can be automatically added to your MailChimp list. Yes, absolutely, Wix allows you to create multiple site and even manages these really well within a separate dashboard before you go into the editor. The only thing to be mindful of is that you will need different domains for both these sites but can link to one another should you need. All the best with your website.

<br>

>![question](/assets/question.png) I need to give someone access to my CPanel and my password for my Wix site. So far, customer service has not been able to help and they keep telling me "CName" info. Do I have access to that or is this something that Wix keeps on lockdown?
> >`A:`  This depends what the access is for. You can invite multiple contributors to manage and edit your Wix site - might this be an easier option? [Here's a link to the Wix support guide](https://support.wix.com/en/article/inviting-site-contributors) outlining how you can do this in case you do want to look into it further. If you need to access your CNAME records you can add or update this from the Domains page when you're signed into your Wix account. I'm including [the support page about adding and updating CNAME records](https://support.wix.com/en/article/adding-or-updating-cname-records-in-your-wix-account), hope it helps!

<br>

>![question](/assets/question.png) I just have one question regarding emails. I have a small business and I need a different email address for each of my employees (same domain, just different name). That’s a total of 6 email addresses. If I go with Wix or Squarespace, does that mean I will be paying about $5 per email address? Whereas with Weebly the email is included? Because I really like the Wix and Squarespace designs better, but having to pay $30/month for emails on top of the plan fees would be a deal breaker... I work in the service industry, so we don’t sell anything (in case that makes a difference in your recommending one company over another) Thanks so much!
>> >`A:` Firstly lets break it down, you can use either Wix or Squarespace should you look to combine G-Suite by Google with your store. With G-Suite you will be provided the access to other features such as Google Calendar and Google Drive while also being able to support upto 30 aliases for each domain. Have a little closer look at G-Suites features and what this plugin can help you with [here](https://support.google.com/domains/answer/6304345?hl=en-GB). This is not only a cheaper option for you, but both Wix and Squarespace actively support you in joining your site with this alternative email control system. If you are still undecided over whether to go with Wix or Squarespace however, why not have a close look at my review, this said I should also point out that Squarespace actually give all users G-Suite FREE for the [first year](https://support.squarespace.com/hc/en-us/articles/206542057)! This could be the deciding factor you needed. I hope all of this has helped. All the best with your site, let us know how you get on.

<br>
 
> ![thumb-down](/assets/thumb-down.png) I joined Wix set up the entire site then got to the blog portion and found out there is NO WAY to add archives on a blog. And, worse is that you can't even manage the blogs unless you to insert a full width section that takes up a large portion of the screen instead of the nice, neat column... which ironically they SHOW on their OLD blog. It's terrible and not functional as a blog. I never would have used Wix if I'd known this.
> > Thanks for your comment. Sorry to hear you're having issues with Wix. As a blogging platform, Wix can be limited. Like you said, it doesn't allow for archiving nor does it have an RSS feed. Both these features are available on Weebly and Squarespace however, alongside other useful blogging features such as analytics, social bookmarking, the ability to comment on posts and a search feature. You can read my Weebly review here and my Squarespace review here. Hopefully one of those is better suited to your needs.

<br>

> ![thumb-down](/assets/thumb-down.png) WiX's website builder is great but how they behave business wise is terrible. Before you buy a Premium package they promise "Premium Support". When you've payed you'll detect that you get the very same help files as before. I'm truly earnestly extremely disappointed. If I could migrate the website, I would do it today.
> > hank you for your comment. It's really disappointing to hear your experience with Wix's support hasn't been great. With the premium plans Wix's extra support goes as far as to offer tech tickets, which are then placed within a queue, so potentially they are super busy at this time. Have you tired to reach out on their twitter help and support page to gain a direct response from Wix? Alternatively request a callback from them directly?

<br>

>![thumb-up](/assets/thumb-up.png) I really like what I have heard about Wix. Currently use Squarespace. For a new training business I was going to use Wix. However, I'm concerned that I don't seem to be easily able to export contact information out of their built-in CRM into the CRM I am using. Is this true
> > Thanks for your comment. It's not too complicated on Wix to import/export data but it can seem a bit more daunting as your data must be in JSON format, as opposed to the usual CSV. Once you've got to grips with how to convert your data into the relevant format, however, the process actually becomes quite straightforward. [Here's a useful guide with more info on how exactly it works](https://support.wix.com/en/article/how-to-import-and-export-collection-data-using-the-wix-data-api). Hope that helps and all the best.

<br>

>![thumb-down](/assets/thumb-down.png) Wix SUPER SUCKS for its horrible Email Only customer support!!! They never understand the tech problems I am explaining and they take NO responsibility for any problems. After saving pages and publishing them, I go back the next day and pages are missing, text colors go from white to red, icons no longer linking...Way too many times! The respond 2-3 days later with lame emails taking no responsibility, nor giving help to resolve the issues. BEWARE website builders.
> > Same experience here. They sell you "Premium Support" but their support is all but premium. Actually very sad because their website builder is classy.
> > Thanks for the comment and for bringing this to everyone attention. I couldn't agree more, although Wix offer a really ease to use website builder, there are a couple of concerns over their help and support functionality. I do however think that their knowledge center is really good, especially considering that unlike some of their competitors, they do tell you when they don't offer a certain feature / element and even offer the ability to vote to have it created. Thank you for your comment, sorry to hear that your experience with Wix support hasn't been great. Wix do offer a fantastic knowledge center however, this actually got scored the best across all of the website builders from our in-house research investigation. Should you have any really specific questions why not give them a direct call using their phone support service, you can find all the details [here](https://support.wix.com/en/article/contacting-vip-support) . Wix's phone support is available Monday - Friday 5am to 5pm pacific standard time.

<br>

>![question](/assets/question.png) Wix is great but the new blog has one very big and major disadvantage which creates a major speed issue. The new blog has no ability to set the number of blog posts on your blog page. This actually means that if you frequently write articles, you blog page will become and endless list of articles which takes up a lot of tome when loading the page. Absolutely unacceptable and the ability to add a custom feed is not a solution. I can not understand how such a great platform has this major drawback.
> >`A:` Yes, unfortunately this is a negative of opting for Wix should you wish to have a blogging website. For sole blogging purposes, WordPress is the best choice on the market as it's designed specifically for blogging. If you need a website around your blog though, Weebly is a great choice given that you can have an RSS feed and archive (two features not currently available on Wix). 

<br>

>![thumb-up](/assets/thumb-up.png) Wix enabled me build my agency website without any knowledge of coding.

<br>

>![question](/assets/question.png) If I signed up for Wix plan and receive a free domain for one year, is the domain mine or does Wix retain ownership to it if I do something else after a year? 
> >`A:` When your domain is up for renewal, you get the chance to pay to keep ownership. 

<br>

>![thumb-down](/assets/thumb-down.png) This is so NOT true regarding their tech support! They have the worst I have ever experienced. I am trying to resolve an issue and in order to do so, I have to go to their support page and find the problem I am experiencing, which I cannot find. Thus, I cannot reach them until I am specific on what they have listed. There is no call number and no way for me to reach their call back number because my technical issue does not exist among their template issues. Totally frustrating and ridiculous. Now I don't know what to do. Just give us a number or chat line we can reach you by Wix.
> >  Sorry to hear you've had a bad Wix experience. The number you need to call will depend on what country you're in. [Follow the link](https://support.wix.com/en/article/contacting-wix-support) on and log in to your Wix account to find the number that's right for you. Hope this helps!

<br>

>![thumb-up](/assets/thumb-up.png) Now Wix [allowing visitors to comment (timestamps) on Wix Video.](https://support.wix.com/en/article/allowing-your-visitors-to-comment-on-wix-video)

<br>

>![thumb-down](/assets/thumb-down.png) Functionality is great as are templates and ease of building the site. problems: load time and lags with editing, freezing of screen, and most importantly it's NOT RESPONSIVE. The entire framework is not responsive. Kind of a huge oversight that makes it absolutely useless.
> > What Wix templates are you using? In our experience, Wix sites do tend to be responsive. Thank you for getting in touch.

<br>

>![question](/assets/question.png) I have a question. I’m undecided between Weebly and Wix, and it’s because the storage on both paid plans. I’m planning to do a website for a non profit and I have lots of videos, photos and files to put on it and my concern is the limited space that Wix offers, just 10 GB in this case. Can you help me to figure out a solution to this issue? 
> >`A:` You can increase your Wix site's storage by upgrading to a more advanced plan. We've got more specific information [here](https://www.websitebuilderexpert.com/website-builders/wix/wix-pricing/)

<br>

>![thumb-up](/assets/thumb-up.png) Am new here, But to be sincere WIX is practically the best, It makes it soo easy for me to open an online store, The issue is that I wanna subscribe for the premium,but am kinda scared of the monthly shit,am I not suppose to buy the domain once of better still A year.
> > Whether Wix premium is right for you will depend on a host of factors. 

<br>

>![thumb-down](/assets/thumb-down.png) Had a horrible experience with Wix and their customer service: I paid for a yearly premium subscription, worked on the website for 1 day and got the account blocked. They didn't even bother sending me an email about that, I had to find out myself. After lots of back and forth and me sending them my credit card scan and passport, they said they won't reactivate my account, without providing me any more information on why they did it nor providing any solution. I have a coaching business and I'd like to create a nice website, with a nice design and easy to manage for a non-developer like me. What's the best option besides Wix for a user friendly and easy to customise website? Thanks!
> > Sorry to hear you had a bad experience with Wix Anna, have you checked out Weebly?

<br>

>![thumb-up](/assets/thumb-up.png) I liked WIX very much, but they don't allow more than 30 items in an Amazon Affiliate website. That makes it impractical for eCommerce. It's too bad because I like their templates - they're very flexible and you can do practically anything with them. The support is great too.
> > If you're finding the 30-product Amazon cap limiting you might want to check out a dedicated ecommerce platform like Shopify? Agree with you on Wix's templates and support, although I do think Wix is great for ecommerce because of its simplicity. Good luck selling online!

<br>

>![thumb-up](/assets/thumb-up.png) Wix is actually a good place for u to start your website and your business. For those who wish to start their business online without paying for website, this is a good opportunity for u. For me, i love this wix . it helps me to build up a free website to roll on my business. i sincerely thank wix for helping me to increase my business and improve my business well. hope to get more templates design and it will be better. hope to see the changes. :) Thank you wix!!!
> > Great to hear you've had such a positive experience of using Wix. It really is a great starter platform if you're new to website building, and the amount of tools + templates you get even on a free plan are impressive. I agree with you that it's definitely a good option if you need to create an online presence for your small business. The paid premium plans can help your site grow alongside your business too!

<br>

> ![thumb-down](/assets/thumb-down.png) I found Wix easy to use until it came time for posting from a mobile device. I could not edit from a mobile device (tablet) which is what I travel with. Although I like the ease of Wix and the templates, I will have to find a new platform since I don’t travel with my laptop. With so many travel bloggers and traveling web site owners, you would think this would not be a problem.
> > I get your frustration - I'm also much more likely to travel with my phone and tablet than take my laptop with me everywhere I go. It makes sense that you should be able to edit your site on-the-go, right? It's something Wix should really consider and address. I know this [feature has been requested by Wix users](https://support.wix.com/en/article/request-editing-your-site-from-a-mobile-device-or-tablet) and with Wix's current growth hopefully they will address it sooner rather than later. But if you're looking for an alternative platform that lets you edit on the go, you could have a look at Weebly? Weebly lets you edit your site directly from your tablet (on both Apple and Android), so it could be just what you're looking for. The interface is really easy to use (even more so than Wix's desktop editor) and you also got some great looking travel/blogging templates to work with. Have a read of our review above and see what you think... Or you can jump right into a Weebly free account and test it out [here](https://www.weebly.com/)

<br>

>![question](/assets/question.png) I'm considering migrating my website to Wix as I used Serif Webplus since 2000 to build my existing site but they've abandoned web creation software. I found your review very helpful. My questions are theses: 1. My site is currently independently hosted with email included. Should I or even can I stick with my existing host when I upgrade to a paid version of Wix? 2. At the moment I achieve page 1 position 1 or 2 on Google organic listing when searching for my service in my city is Chimney sweep Bath. I'm really worried about trashing my SEO and loosing my place in Google searches. The truth is I don't really know how I achieved this in the first place. I'd appreciate your thoughts. 
> >`A:` Thanks for reading and joining the conversation. Wow that's quite a while you've been with Serif Webplus, it's impressive. I won't lie, I've never even heard of them until now! I imagine the website builder game has changed a fair bit since you first started out Ben, but Wix definitely has all the tools you need to create a great website. So I hope the following helps: 1. Wix will host your website on both a free and paid plan. It won't cost a penny on the free plan but you'll have limited bandwidth, storage and won't be able to use your own domain. A paid plan enables all of these things + more. Unfortunately to integrate email with Wix you'll need to subscribe to a Gsuite account through Wix as it is not offered as part of a current premium plan. 2. This is the delicate one - and I understand how important rankings can be for your online presence, let alone the impact they can have on real world business. It's going to be extremely tricky but long story short, you'll need to recreate your website page for page on Wix and 301 redirect each page to the newly created one. In theory this should minimize the impact on your rankings. However, so many things could go wrong that I really suggest you talk to an SEO specialist that you trust if you want to go down this route. So many factors can affect this Ben that I can't give you definitive advice, just best practice rule of thumbs. Things like how competitive your ranking search terms (e.g. what people search to find your website) will impact this move, having two sites live at once (while the redirect architecture is put in place) can impact it too..but likewise, if there aren't many chimney sweeps in Bath then it could all work out ok (as it's not a hugely competitive space!) In this instance, it might be worth seeking out an SEO or web migration professional for some expert advice. Be aware this could be a costly route and there's no guaranteed success. I'm sorry I can't be more specific, but hopefully the above gives you food for thought.

<br>

>![question](/assets/question.png) I checked out another review website of web hosting companies and learned about 000 webhost. Com and X10 hosting.com. When they explained all the services you receive for the free site such as emails and bandwidth and all the other specs it seemed from what I read that x10hosting. Com was much better than w i x.. So I'm wondering why your side doesn't make mention of these two websites? And also ipage.com. what is your opinion of these different hosting companies? And how do they compare to Wicks and Weebly?
> >`A:` Both 000webhost and x10hosting.com are hosting + domain name sites first, website builders second. They white label other website builders and use them as their own. You can see in 000webhost's screengrabs that you're actually using a builder called 'Zyro Builder', which is a very simple builder compared to Wix and Weebly. Long story short, they're inferior products who make themselves seem more attractive to you with generous hosting offers - just look at both companies names, they are hosting companies first and foremost. Think about mobile phone contracts. You can expect to pay a premium for a Samsung or an iPhone because they are premium products, whose users find real benefit in what they can do with them. On the other hand you can also find much cheaper phone contracts for inferior phones. I guess it comes down to which sort of product you prefer? Weebly is one of the most user-friendly builders in my opinion. It offers unlimited bandwidth + storage on it's cheapest paid plan and also has a super easy-to-use editor. The support is very good and you have a great choice of templates + tools. Likewise, Wix is easily the best all-round-website builder on the market. It offers over 500 eye-catching templates, loads of editing tools, lots support documents and all sorts of apps and add-ons that you just don't get anywhere else. Sure, you get a little less bandwidth on Wix's cheapest plan, but for the price of a coffee each month you can upgrade to both unlimited bandwidth and storage. Personally, I don't mind paying a little extra for a quality product if I know it will help me achieve what I want to. Both Weebly and Wix offer free plans so I'd really recommend having a play and seeing how you get on. I think you'll be won over, Dan! Hope that helps

<br>

>![question](/assets/question.png) just curious, is it better if I use wix to get my domain from them or to get it on my own from maybe Go daddy? or whoever you recommend? If I get through wix and one day I leave them and host site elsewhere will I be able to use my domain? so will they own it or will I??
> >`A:` There's no 'real' difference between buying a domain from Wix or GoDaddy. But I would always recommend getting your domain from a 3rd party as it makes it easier to take with you if you ever want to move platform. It can be a lot more fiddly to extricate if purchased through the website builder itself. It's best to compartmentalize and keep your website builder + domain separate (well that's my two cents at least!). Hope that helps.  If you buy a custom domain from either a third party or Wix then you will own that domain. You've paid for it, so it is yours. Wix lets you purchase domains through them to simplify the process (so you don't have to go elsewhere if you don't want to!). I recommend using a third party because it makes it a bit easier to take your domain with you if you ever want to move from Wix, that's all. It's not a huge issue, but it's just a little simpler.

<br>

>![question](/assets/question.png) Thanks for this great review. One thing I'm concerned about is the cost of email hosting through Wix. It adds another $4+ per email address. That seems pretty expensive. Do you know of any cheaper alternatives? That adds almost $150/yr to the cost of hosting.
> >`A:` Good to know you found the review handy, Wix is a great platform for non-technical users to get themselves an online presence with. I understand your concerns about the potential stacking of costs per user, but this is unfortunately one of the knock-on effects having your own mailbox (i.e. email addresses with your website in the address - info@demowebsite.com as opposed to demowebsite@gmail.com). I guess it comes down to what you want to achieve. Having a personalized mailbox looks more professional so is pretty vital if you want it for business purposes. However, if it's not for professional uses, then there's no reason to feel obliged to us Wix's Gsuite partnership and incur costs. An alternative would be to create gmail accounts and then include the email addresses as links on your site so that people can still contact you, but without you paying the monthly fee. Hope that helps

<br>

>![question](/assets/question.png) I have tried wix more than once,but I always struggle building the site, for example I was finally able to create a gallery but I was unable to load any photos, since I'm not to savy, by paying for VIP subscription will someone be able to help me to build my site
> >`A:` Sorry to hear you've struggled a bit with Wix! It can be a little tricky at first if you're not too tech savvy - but I'm sure if you stick with it you will master it in no time. (As heads up, here's how to add/remove images from a gallery: drag the gallery onto your page from the left hand 'ADD' menu, then move your mouse over the gallery and click 'Manage Media'. Now click '+ Add Media' in the top right, then 'Upload Media' in the window that pops up. Select the images/videos from your computer and you're done! To delete images, click 'Manage Media', then move your mouse over the image you don't want and click the little garbage can that appears in the bottom right of the image.) To help you out a bit and give you a kick-start, Marilyn, [here's a collection of tutorial videos from Wix](https://www.wix.com/blog/2016/11/10-wix-essential-tutorials/) that will show you how the editor works so that your website will look great in no time. And if you still want to look into professional help with your website, [Wix have in-house experts that can lend you hand](https://www.wix.com/arena/web-designers/1).

<br>

>![question](/assets/question.png) Is it possible to make a transfer of my WIX website to my host ?
> >`A:` By transfer, do you mean take a website from Wix and move the whole thing to another host? If so, no, you can't do this. Wix websites are built on the Wix platform and so can't work without it. It's like taking the engine out of a Ferrari and putting into into a Smart car - they're both engines, but designed to work with different cars. It's the same with your Wix website. Sure, you can copy content and move your images over, but you'll need to recreate your website from scratch unfortunately. Wix also offers numerous paid plans and the slightly more expensive ones offer pretty much all the space and all the features you're probably going to need, so this could be worth looking into. 

<br>

>![question](/assets/question.png) E-commerce Premium plan comes with debit card payment ?
> >`A:` Wix eCommerce premium plans can accept debit card payments from your shoppers. You can set this up in the 'Payments Tab'. Wix outlines how to do this [here](https://support.wix.com/en/article/accepting-payments-by-credit-card).

<br>

>![thumb-up](/assets/thumb-up.png) I currently use Wix for my husbands website for his business. The ease of the design and the professional look, you'd never know I've never put a website together before. Wix also made suggestions for areas or pages that I hadn't thought of, and they give you ideas on how to word certain areas so they sound more professional than most of us business newbies would think of. The stock images are great quality and on topic, but you still have the freedom to add your own loge and pictures. The templates saved me as far as keeping my husband's life's work looking professional! I ultimately got the premium plan and couldn't be happier.
> >`A:` It's so great to hear such positive feedback! If you take your time then you can create a truly stunning website with Wix - and it sounds like you've nailed it, good work :) Best of luck with your site + thanks for reading

<br>

>![question](/assets/question.png) I just opened my website with wix using a premium plan. I just had one query will I be able to take Booking for holiday stays as an agent on wix? Will it help me boost my site and reach out to a lot of people ?
> >`A:` You certainly can use Wix to take holiday bookings via the [Wix Bookings](https://www.wix.com/app-market/wix-bookings/overview) App. The Wix editor has an SEO optimization section that you can use to improve your site and help boost its online visibility. You won't appear on page 1 of Google overnight, but with time, patience and other marketing you should see the traffic that you want to. 

<br>

>![question](/assets/question.png) Am an owner of a small business & have purchased a Wix Premium package for my website. There is no doubt that they have very stunning design templates & its very easy to use the platform. However, 2 very fundamental drawbacks of the platform - the mobile website performance & (lack of) event tracking. More than 80% of the website traffic today is thru mobile & Wix just doesn't deliver efficiently on the mobile platform at all - the page load times even for a simple page is as high as 13 to 14 seconds! Event tracking again, especially on non-ecommerce sites, is a fundamental requirement. A small business owner, for example, would like to know if anyone clicked the call button to make a phone call to our company. But you just can't do it! After being a customer of Wix for almost an year, am thinking of moving out of the platform now due to these issues
> >`A:`  It's great to hear that you've had a generally very positive response to using Wix, it really is a good option for smaller businesses. And it's true that mobile traffic makes up an ever increasing amount of website visitors, which is why Wix has added a 'mobile specific' editor mode to help you optimize your website for this. It sounds like your issue is more with load speed than the mobile editing process - and this can be impacted by numerous things including: - number of images / videos on your pages - file size of images / videos / media on your pages - Your internet connection - capabilities of the hardware you're using to browse the internet So it's not necessarily Wix that is slowing your site. It's best to double check the above and then review your load speeds. I'd recommend using www.kraken.io to shrink image file sizes. As for tracking, I know you can add google analytics to Wix, which should provide a much needed degree of transparency to your site and how it is being used. But when it comes to specific event tracking (such as clicking buttons), that requires google Tag Manager, which is currently listed as a 'feature request' on the Wix website, so hopefully we will see it sooner rather than later! An alternate to tracking whether people pressed the 'call' button, would be to add a contact form to your Wix website (very easy to do!), which then lets your customers send a message to your email inbox directly from your website. Hope that helps

<br>

>![question](/assets/question.png) I am doing a school project and would love some insight of why someone should choose Wix instead of another builder such as Weebly. Any insight would help!
> >`A:` I think you could pick any of the reasons in the article above as to why Wix is a better website builder than Weebly. Yes they are both easy to use, but Wix provides more tools, templates and apps to maximize your website's potential. Wix's support is more in-depth and it has a wider choice of premium plans that help you specialize your site.

>![question](/assets/question.png) Please tell if I can import themes from sites like themeforest.net and use in making own website on wix.com. Thanx.
> >`A:` As I understand it, Themeforest creates templates for WordPress. This means they will not work with Wix as Wix is built in a totally different manner to WordPress. It's worth mentioning though that Wix's drag and drop features make it really simple to design your website since you can literally drag and drop any elements around. So if you find a design that you like on ThemeForest, you can try to replicate it in Wix - cheeky, but effective! :) Hope that helps

>![question](/assets/question.png) Tell me something please, after i make a website on wix under free plan, can I take the code and database to another hosting site like siteground.com etc? ((I think as per your reviews the answer is No.)) Is the export functionality given in any paid plan or another free website builder, like weebly maybe? What all can be exported exactly?
> >`A:` Unfortunately you cannot export your Wix website to use on another platform - it's just not designed for that purpose. It would be like taking the engine out of a Ferrari and trying to use it in a Ford - it's just not engineered to work like that! Different builders provide different levels of export functionality, for example Weebly lets export a fair chunk of your material. It would be worth having a little look into the limitations of the more popular builders when it comes to exporting/importing before you commit to any one platform. hope that helps

>![thumb-up](/assets/thumb-up.png) I have used Wix in the past and it was a very good experience. Do you know if a storefront can be password protected in Wix, or any other reasonably priced platform? I have a small business and need a very simple wholesale storefront solution. I don't have the saavy to use Woocommerce. A builder would be great, I can do that. My wish list would be to password protect the storefront with returning customer login capability so their information would be stored.The B2B platforms are much more sophisticated and expensive than what I need. Any help would be greatly appreciated!!! I have looked around a lot and can't figure this out.
> >  I believe Wix can help you with your issue. [Here's a guide](https://support.wix.com/en/article/password-protecting-your-site-or-a-specific-page) to password protecting pages on your website. If you can password protect your homepage then this will in effect shut off the rest of your site from users. Wix also lets you create members-only areas so you can really control who sees what in your store. I've linked to the password protecting guide for you

>![question](/assets/question.png) I've built a free website Wix website. I don't mind the ads, but here is what I'm running into. It looks great on a regular computer or laptop. And it also looks great on any Mobile phone. However, when I take my Wix URL and cloak and mask it with my Godaddy domain name and open up the site on my mobile phone using the Godaddy domain, the site becomes very small and slender. I have to manually widen it to fill out the screen on my phone. It only happens with it's masked with the Godaddy domain, and not when I put the actual Wix URL into my cell phone browser (Google). Has anyone else experienced that? If so, what's the problem and can it be fixed? Or is it one of those things where the only way it can work properly is by upgrading to Combo?
> >`A:` The first thing I would say is that masking your URL via GoDaddy really isn't the best way to go about things because - just as you've seen - it can really impact your website. From my understanding, the issue is that when you mask the URL it stops the mobile version of your website from loading and instead loads the desktop version, which is why you're seeing a more narrow and odd looking website. If you subscribe to a Wix premium plan, then you can use your own custom domain (URL) directly with no need to mask - this will solve your problem.

>![question](/assets/question.png) I am trying to navigate inside slideshows inside lightboxes and I can't navigate through the keyboard arrows throught the pictures. I cannot seem to find a wix community forum anymore, or any way inside their webside to chat for help, or even send an e-mail for help on that matter. It seems like such an easy issue, and they are not addressing it in the Help section.
> >`A:`  I'm not actually sure it's possible to achieve this! I agree that it does sound like a common-sense sort of issue - using your keyboard direction arrows to move slides in a slideshow - but I actually haven't seen it on a Wix site. I think this might be because the lightbox is created by CSS code, which you can't access on Wix due to the type of web design it allows. So your lightbox is more of a way to display content and isn't "functional" in the same way you can use the up and down arrows to scroll the webpage up or down. It may be possible on a platform like WordPress but as far as I know, you can't achieve this on Wix right now. Thanks for reading, hope that clears things up.

>![question](/assets/question.png) I find the Wix website wonderful except that I can't absorb the mass of information. My need is for a fairly simple eCommerce website with Blog potential. I currently have a hosted website in Australia. Does Wix actually host websites? Can Wix host an 'au' domain? Does Wix have 90% complete ready-made websites with shopping and blog capabilities that I can simply edit? 
> >`A:` Wix should definitely be able to help you out in this situation. If you choose one of Wix's pre-designed ecommerce templates as a starting point, you only need to do minimal tweaking to make the design your own, which should save you a huge amount of work. Wix also provides all hosting services so that you don't need to purchase that separately. This also means that Wix will manage all the technical aspects so you don't have to worry about them. You can also add a blog section with a just a few clicks.

<br>

>![question](/assets/question.png) I tend to research the heck out of everything. I was leaning towards Wix when I discovered it does not have responsive design. That's kind of a big issue in today's mobile world, no? My target market tends to be fairly mobile so I'm concerned about this aspect of Wix. thoughts please?
> >`A:`  You're absolutely right - being mobile ready is such an important thing to consider when designing your website. Wix can be a little confusing because while Wix sites are not "fully mobile responsive", they are "mobile friendly". This is because Wix actually combines two editors into one. You can switch between the desktop and mobile editor with the click of a button, so that you can optimize your site for both desktop and mobile platforms and ensure there are no issues! So as long as you take a bit of time to get things just right in the mobile editor, your site should look great whenever and wherever it is viewed.

<br>

>![question](/assets/question.png) My ultimate question: is a wix-website, made on a desk top computer, moblie friendly by itself?? Or should a make some adjustments before?
> >`A:` To optimise your site and make it mobile friendly on Wix, you will need to go into the Wix Editor. In the top menu bar, to the left of 'Save', 'Preview', and 'Publish' you will see a little smartphone icon. Click this phone icon and you will be taken to the mobile editor. This is where you can optimize your site for mobile devices. So it's worth pointing out that Wix has a dedicated mobile editor that allows you to customize the user interface. Other drag & drop website builders don't offer this function.

>![question](/assets/question.png) I have been using Wix for a number of years and will eventually go premium, it is very functional and serves my purpose at the moment until I want to add the online shop facilities. I do need some assistance for the moment though. When I share my page, the image that I have chosen doesn't appear. It some times uses a random image!!!! I have uploaded the image I want to use and saved/publish but it will not change. I am sure that the image size is fine because it was working but not now. can you assist. Maybe I am doing something wrong.
> >`A:`  Great to hear that you've had such a positive experience with Wix overall. Your image issue does sound like a bit of stumper, hopefully it hasn't been going on for long? Have you tried viewing your site on other computers because this would quickly establish if the issue was on Wix's end or an issue with the computer you're working from. If it is only on your end, you may need to clear your cache or look at the firewalls/anti-virus you have in place. Wix also have [a support page for this issue](https://support.wix.com/en/article/unable-to-view-images-on-your-site). Hope that helps

>![question](/assets/question.png) Having just taken over a Wix website I find it is extremely hard to manage. Adding content has me pulling my hair out and support is a joke. I have spent three days just trying to clone a button to an existing menu with no luck! None of the help videos work. I manage a site on a different host that is much easier to work with. That one is free (for our personal non-profit) and this one is a paid premium site (for an organization). If you want to build a site that never changes this might work for you. If you like to stay current and have a good experience changing your site to reflect your current or future content - stay away from here.
> >`A:` Sorry to hear you've struggled a bit with Wix. From my own experience as well as from the vast majority of users, Wix's intuitive 'what you see is what you get' editor couldn't be easier to use. You simply drag and drop and voila, the element is on the page! I also wholeheartedly disagree that Wix is for static websites only because it's simplicity, huge customization options and richly populated app store are ideal for continually finessing and optimizing your site.
