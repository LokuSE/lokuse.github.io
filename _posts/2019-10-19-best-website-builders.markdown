# Best Website Builders for 2020
    
My name is Vadim Radionov and I have worked as a product manager for the last 4 years, and before that, I worked as an SEO strategist for 5 years.

I had to work with more than 20 website builders. I did not just test them for 1 day for a review, but I worked with them for many months as a product manager and SEO specialist.

Therefore, I want to share my experience with you and tell you about the best website builders.

There are only 3-4 universal site builders that are suitable for any task.

And, you will not believe, only 1 is the best option for eCommerce.

`The Best Website builders that I recommend based on 9 years of experience working with them:`
* WIX — Truly flexible website builder
* Squarespace —  an intuitive website builder with perfect themes and best features
* Weebly — best for anyone who is not tech-savvy
* Shopify — to anyone building an online store, best for eCommerce websites

## [WIX] — Truly Flexible Website Builder

`Wix Pros:`

* Really flexible website builder
* User,  mobile,  SEO friendly templates (500+)
* an App Market with 300+ apps

`Wix Cons:`

* You cannot switch a theme on a live site

One of the most flexible and customizable website builders. You can make a site from scratch or use ready-made templates. You can connect marketing tools, such as email newsletters, push notifications, etc. It is also not a problem to connect payment on site.

If you have a ready-made business or just an idea for a startup, you can test it very quickly and cheaply. `For this, there are many special templates tailored for a specific business area:`

* [E-commerce]
* [Restaurants]
* [Hotels]
* [Musicians]
* [Photographers]
* [Events]
* [Fitness]

[E-commerce]: https://www.wix.com/ecommerce/website
[Restaurants]: https://www.wix.com/restaurant/website
[Hotels]: https://wix.com/hotels/website
[Musicians]: https://wix.com/music/website
[Photographers]: https://www.wix.com/photography/website
[Events]: https://www.wix.com/event/website
[Fitness]: https://www.wix.com/fitness/website

I recommend WIX to those who want to have a margin of functionality for the future, for when your idea or business goes uphill. If necessary, you can easily expand the functionality of the site using the App Market.

`Squarespace Pros:`

* The best for blogging, podcasts, and donations.  Better of any website builder
* Best-in-class features. Everything is thoughtful, nothing is half-baked
* One of the best for eCommerce —  92% customer satisfaction. The top is Shopify with 97%. But  Shopify was designed purely for eCommerce.
* Apple Pay Integration. Best for mobile payments. It lets customer authorize payments with only Touch ID
* Squarespace is one of the only website builders to support AMP pages. [Just enable it]
* You can switch between templates and keep your content (Hello, WIX )
* Squarespace allows export and import data 
* Perfect customer support & help article database

`Cons of Squarespace:`

* No phone support (but you have 24/7 support through email tickets and live chat)
* No app store (mean does not have a ton of apps) because It’s an all-in-one platform. It is also cons. Fewer issues after adding a plugin. 
* No autosave for pages or posts

I can recommend Squarespace. It's one of the best comprehensive website builder.  They were able to combine an intuitive website builder with perfect themes, best (in market) features and competitive pricing plans.

## [Shopify] — Best Ecommerce Website Builder

If your goal is to build a purely commercial site, I recommend Shopify.

Today, Shopify functionality covers all business needs in e-commerce. At the same time, it remains simple and understandable for the product owner.

A distinctive feature of Shopify is an application store that covers any marketing and product functionality not available in the core.

There are other eCommerce website builders, but they do not cover a fifth of the functionality available in the App Store Shopify.

![Shopify-app-store-statistics](/assets/shopify-app-store-statistics.jpg)
Shopify has much more applications than competitors.

**In addition to a huge app store, Shopify has launched and supports such innovative functionality as:**

* Shopify Payments
* Shopify Augmented Reality
* Shopify POS

[Shopify powers over 1000,000 businesses], you can try Shopify free for 90 days, no credit card required. `That's why I highly recommend Shopify to anyone building an online store.`
